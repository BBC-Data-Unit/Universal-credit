In March 2021, the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-56127385) parts of the UK reliant on tourism had been most affected by the Covid-19 jobs crisis, according to analysis.

In some areas, around three out of five people who began claiming universal credit at the outset of the pandemic were still doing so six months later.

Experts said areas with seasonal employment were more likely to see furloughed workers, those in low-wage jobs or on zero-hours contracts.

The government said it was boosting welfare support by "billions" to help.
